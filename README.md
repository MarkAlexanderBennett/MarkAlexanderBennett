<h2 >About Me:</h2>

I am an Australian that has been in the construction industry since 2004, working as an Engineering Surveyor. I rose up the ranks to become a Senior Surveyor working on numerous large scale commerical projects in both Brisbane, Melbourne and Western Australia. My Full Surveying history can be found on my linkedIn profile https://www.linkedin.com/in/mark0bennett/
As a surveyor my main job was problem solving using the tools and techniques that I have at my disposal, theses qualities are also found in a developer and I see many similarities between the two professions.

I started self learning coding in Java in September 2021 with the aim of one day gaining employment as a developer. I have been fortunate as my closest friend is a Backend java Developer and he has been my mentor and guided me along the way.

I have completed many online tutorials including University of Helsinki MOOC Java Programming I and II which can be found in my 'Certificates' Repo.
